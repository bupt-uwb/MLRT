## dataset

The data set is divided into two parts, including identification and fall activities, as seen in Figure. Overall, experiments are performed with 11 healthy subjects including different genders and body sizes. Almost the same gender ratio is observed (female n = 6, male n = 5). The height of subjects ranges from 160 to 187cm and the weight of subjects ranges from 51 to 85kg. The relevant information about the participants in the experiments is shown in Table.


In the 20 sec radar signal of the fall event, targets walk freely in the hall for the first 10 sec and fall down perpendicular to the radar line of sight with a distance of 2 meters from the radar. Each event takes about 20 seconds and the fall will occur at a random time in the last ten seconds. A event of each target repeats 30 times, including 15 fall events and 15 non-fall events. In non-fall events, the target will walk randomly for 20 sec.

## code
The code contains two parts: fall detection and identification.
